# Engin Calculator Software

Open the dist file, and then the controller and run the .exe file located within

It may not work for all systems due to compatability and Windows not allowing unsigned files.
However all the code is available on the GitHub page -- https://github.com/GedikEngin/engin-maths-calculator
There should be a YouTube tutorial available on the following channel demonstrating the program running -- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFDWT6cJpQFm3KfmA6nP0Q

Thank you
